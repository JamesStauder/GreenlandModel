DATA:
TODO: ADD LINK TO DATA
Colormap and all data need to be uploaded to the .data directory
All data is the dataset with all the underlying data. It is an hdf5 file with the velocity, surface, bed etc. data as numpy arrays. The currently available dataset have a larger resolution ~900m. A larger dataset with 150m resolution will be available soon.

The colormap data file is also a hdf5 file but the data are 8bit length 3 RGB arrays. There is a colormap for each of the underlying data sets. The colormaps are full resolution so the file size is 3 GB.
